                                    <p><strong>Virus Protection</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>All GoDaddy.com email accounts include state-of-the-art Virus Protection system and automatically
                                        blocks infected email attachments that may damage your computer with destructive
                                        viruses. Virus scanning occurs every time the servers receive an incoming attachment.
                                        Virus Protection is in place for both Webmail and POP3 email clients (Outlook, Outlook
                                        Express, etc...) so that any emails that contain an infected attachment are automatically
                                        blocked.

                                    <p><strong>GoDaddy.com Anti-Phishing Technology</strong></p>
                                    <p>As more and more communication and transactions are taking place online, phishing schemes
                                        and other attempts to steal sensitive personal information have become increasingly
                                        prevalent and innovative.</p>
                                    <p>GoDaddy.com's advanced fraud protection program effectively protects you from phishing
                                        schemes by detecting and intercepting phishing schemes and other fraudulent email
                                        messages before they reach your inbox. GoDaddy.com detects phishing schemes by examining
                                        the links embedded in incoming mail messages. If a link appears to be pointing to
                                        legitimate site, but in fact leads to a fraudulent destination; the message will
                                        be considered fraudulent and thus intercepted.</p>
                                    <p>A phishing scheme typically consists of an email message that appears to originate from
                                        a trusted source, but in fact is an attempt to obtain and exploit sensitive user
                                        information, such as login credentials for the targeted user's online bank account.
                                        The mail message likely will contain a link that appears to lead to an authorized
                                        Web site that belongs to a legitimate, trusted company. The idea is to make the email
                                        user take the bait by clicking the link and providing the requested data to the fraudulent
                                        party, which will then attempt to exploit the obtained information.</p>
                                    <p>As a GoDaddy.com email user, you will not actually notice the fraud-protection technology
                                        in action, as it operates behind the scenes. However, the advanced technology will
                                        have an instant impact on your mail account as much fewer – if any – fraudulent mail
                                        messages will appear in your inbox.</p>
